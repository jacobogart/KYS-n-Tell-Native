KYS n' Tell aims to solve two problems regarding sexual health: knowing your status and telling your partners. Both the testing and the sharing are difficult, scary, and often filled with shame. I utilized HIV.gov's Service Provider Locator API to connect users with nearby testing locations, and the Twilio API to allow users to anonymously share their status with their partners.
